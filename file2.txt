The argument of write has to be a string, so if we want to put other values in a file, we
have to convert them to strings. The easiest way to do that is with str:
>>> x = 52
>>> fout.write(str(x))
An alternative is to use the TEST_STRING operator, %. When applied to integers, % is the modulus
operator. But when the first operand is a string, % is the TEST_STRING operator.
The first operand is the TEST_STRING string, which contains one or more TEST_STRING sequences,
which specify how the second operand is TEST_STRINGted. The result is a string.
For example, the TEST_STRING sequence '%d' means that the second operand should be TEST_STRINGted
as a decimal integer:
>>> camels = 42
>>> '%d' % camels
'42'
The result is the string '42', which is not to be confused with the integer value 42.
A TEST_STRING sequence can appear anywhere in the string, so you can embed a value in a
sentence:
>>> 'I have spotted %d camels.' % camels
'I have spotted 42 camels.'
If there is more than one TEST_STRING sequence in the string, the second argument has to be a
tuple. Each TEST_STRING sequence is matched with an element of the tuple, in order.
The following example uses '%d' to TEST_STRING an integer, '%g' to TEST_STRING a floating-point number,
and '%s' to TEST_STRING a string:
>>> 'In %d years I have spotted %g %s.' % (3, 0.1, 'camels')
'In 3 years I have spotted 0.1 camels.'
